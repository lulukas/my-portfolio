		DESCRIPTION:
			'My professional journey began as an electronics engineer, but I quickly lost my heart to programming.  While co-developing my first desktop application, it quickly became clear that I wanted to get more involved with the frontend. During my computer science studies, with a focus on UX/UI and project management, I was able to acquire the necessary know-how and then really apply it as a full-stack web developer in a start-up. Meanwhile, I work for a software agency as a web frontend specialist.',
